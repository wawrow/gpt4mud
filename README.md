Simple Serverless, Multiplayer WebScoket based Text game

Started this project as a test for ChatGPT abilities, but very quickly it became too complex for it to handle the complexity. 

Is "somewhat" working (lets you connect and move around) - but will require a deep cleanup of the chatGPT halucinations to make it work better.

It is quite cool though that it works serverlessly.
